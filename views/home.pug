    h2 A Blockquote
    blockquote
      p.
        Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever
        encountered to help me make the big choices in life, because almost
        everything, all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment
        or failure, these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only
        what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best
        way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You
        are already naked.  There is no reason not to follow your heart.
