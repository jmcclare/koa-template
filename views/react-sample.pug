    | This is the finished&#32;

    | The main JSX code for this sample app is in&#32;
    code site_modules/assets/_js/

  p
    | That is linked to&#32;
    code assets/_js/tic-tac-toe

  p
    | The&#32;
    code Game
    | &#32;component is imported and rendered by&#32;
    code assets/_js/react-app.jsx

  p
    | Webpack is setup to compile the JSX starting with&#32;
    code assets/_js/react-app.jsx
    | &#32;as an entry point. See&#32;
    code core/webpack.config.coffee
    | &#32;and&#32;
    code gulpfile.coffee

  p
    | The template for this page (
    code views/react-sample.pug
    | ) adds a script tag that links to&#32;
    code /_js/react-app.js

  p
    | Thatâ€™s where WebPack either serves or writes the compiled JavaScript.

  p
    | The CSS is in&#32;
    code site_modules/assets/_css/

  p
    | That is linked to&#32;
